 --channels-type=<type>
        Set the type of memory connections.
        Possible values for <type> are:
            MEM_ACC_11 - the accesses to the memory have a single direct
                         connection or a single indirect connection (default)
            MEM_ACC_N1 - the accesses to the memory have n parallel direct
                         connections or a single indirect connection
            MEM_ACC_NN - the accesses to the memory have n parallel direct
                         connections or n parallel indirect connections

   --channels-number=<n>
        Define the number of parallel direct or indirect accesses.

When BRAMs are involved only two ports at maximum could be given
When option --memory-allocation-policy=EXT_PIPELINED_BRAM is given the number of channels could be greater than 2
