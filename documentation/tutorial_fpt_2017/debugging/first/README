The directory contains three files.
The file main.c the C code that we want to translate to Verilog using High-Level
Synthesis (HLS).
The top-level function is compute() and it uses a number of auxiliary functions
that have to be mapped to the external verilog modules available in
operations.v.
In operations.c it is possible to find the golden reference implementation in C
for those very same modules.

You are required to do the complete the following steps.

1) Do the necessary steps to integrate the verilog modules for `plus`, `minus`,
`times`, `divide`, and `times2` (contained in operations.v) in a the HLS design
synthesized with bambu. The top-level module of the final design must be the
compute() function in main.c.

2) Write your own test cases for the whole design, passing them to the
co-simulation workflow through an xml file with the proper format.
Then run the bambu co-simulation flow, on the generated design, to check that
behavior of the generated design is NOT compliant with the golden reference.

3) Use Discrepancy Analysis to localize the hardware module that is not
respecting the specifications.
